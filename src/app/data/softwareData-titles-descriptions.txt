Latent Spaces
THE PROBLEM
Current AI interfaces hide the vast possibilities behind each prompt, forcing users to repeatedly refine queries to discover alternative perspectives—wasting time and concealing the model's true nature.

THE SOLUTION
Using the Latent Spaces Loom interface, users can generate, visualize, and branch multiple AI responses simultaneously, revealing the hidden multiverse of possible continuations. This approach delivers measurable advantages:

• Increases productivity by 10x through parallel exploration of multiple response paths
• Provides unprecedented insights into model behavior that improve prompt engineering skills
• Builds intuition for AI reasoning patterns through visual representation of branching possibilities

Record Machine
THE PROBLEM
Musicians have a lot to keep track of when preparing for a release - various mixes and masters, lyrics, voice memos, artwork, and more. These pieces of the puzzle are often scattered across various platforms and devices, making it difficult and time-consuming to stay productive.

THE SOLUTION
Record Machine is an iOS app that streamlines the process of organizing and previewing a release. It allows users to keep track of everything in one place, and features a built-in music player that mimics popular streaming platforms.

Check Right In
THE PROBLEM
A local church's New Members class needed a better way to track attendance than paper records, with class sizes of 80+ people. Accurate tracking was critical since members needed to attend a minimum number of sessions to join the church.

THE SOLUTION
I created Check Right In, an app for checking large numbers of class members in via a network of tablets at the entrance. This streamlined solution saved a lot of time, reduced headaches, and created a sustainable way to manage and track attendance.
